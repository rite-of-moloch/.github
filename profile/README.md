# RiteOfMoloch - No HR for DAOs.

Any DAO can use RoM to deploy a cohort, where participants lock an amount of tokens towards a defined goal. If a set of conditions is met and the staking period did not lapse, successful participants can reclaim their stake. Otherwise cohort administrators can slash participantsâ€™ funds to the benefit of the DAO. Hence, the DAO is incentivised to define goals that are measurable and achievable because otherwise no one would ever stake funds. Individuals now have financial alignment to a cause they choose, while completing tasks.
